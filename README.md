# Exothermic-CSTR-Multivariate-Alarm-Systems
Repository of Scripts Developed for Developing and Testing Multivariate Alarm Systems for Exothermic CSTR.
i) To conduct the BG-FFS Simulations, simply run the "Call_BG_Prop_Control.m" script on MATLAB. For predictive modeling, run the "pB_model_construction.m" script on MATLAB.

ii) To conduct Dynamic Risk Assessment, run the script "Call_File_dynamic_risk_analysis_unpostulated.m" -- make sure tp change the batch_start and batch_end parameters corresponding to the number of batches of DRAn sinulations that is desired.
